# My First Github hosted [site](https://sinchan-s.github.io/)  
This is personalized blogging website on which I intend to post blogs on machine learning and python. Making websites is also a way for me to practice HTML, CSS & JS along with trying out different frontend toolkits and CSS frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and  [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

My first two blog posts are on *<b>Life Cycle of Data</b>* & *<b>Machine Learning in Brief</b>*.  
<b>Here's the website screenshot:</b>
